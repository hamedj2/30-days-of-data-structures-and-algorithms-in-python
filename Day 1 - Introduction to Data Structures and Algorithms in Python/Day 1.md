## Python Basics and Operations

### Arithmetic Operations

Addition (+): Sums two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Deducts one number from another.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides one number by another, yielding a floating-point result.
Floor Division (//): Performs division but rounds down to the nearest integer.
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division.
Exponentiation (**): Raises a number to the power of another number.

### Comparison Operations

Equal (==): Checks if two values are equal.
Not Equal (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
Greater Than (>): Checks if the first value is greater than the second.
Less Than (<): Checks if the first value is less than the second.
Greater Than or Equal To (>=): Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.
Less Than or Equal To (<=): Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.

### Logical Operations

And (and): Returns True if both operands are true.
Or (or): Returns True if at least one operand is true.
Not (not): Negates the boolean value.
Bitwise Operations

AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND.
OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR.
XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR.
NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right.

**Linux:** Python is usually pre-installed. Verify by typing `python3 --version` in the terminal. If not, use your package manager, like `sudo apt install python3` for Ubuntu.

## Python Basics and Operations

### Arithmetic Operations

- [ ] Addition ` (+) `  Sums two numbers. <br>
- [ ] Subtraction ` (-) ` Deducts one number from another. <br>
`Multiplication (*):` Multiplies two numbers. <br>
`Division (/):` Divides one number by another, yielding a floating-point result. <br>
`Floor Division (//):` Performs division but rounds down to the nearest integer. <br>
`Modulus (%):` Returns the remainder of a division. <br>
`Exponentiation (**):` Raises a number to the power of another number. <br>



### Comparison Operations

`Equal (==):` Checks if two values are equal. <br>
`Not Equal (!=):` Checks if two values are not equal. <br>
`Greater Than (>):` Checks if the first value is greater than the second. <br>
`Less Than (<):` Checks if the first value is less than the second. <br>
`Greater Than or Equal To (>=):` Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second. <br>
`Less Than or Equal To (<=):` Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second. <br>

### Logical Operations

`And (and):` Returns True if both operands are true. <br>
`Or (or):` Returns True if at least one operand is true. <br>
`Not (not):` Negates the boolean value. <br>

### Bitwise Operations

`AND (&):` Performs a bitwise AND. <br>
`OR (|):` Performs a bitwise OR. <br>
`XOR (^):` Performs a bitwise XOR. <br>
`NOT (~):` Performs a bitwise NOT. <br>
`Left Shift (<<):` Shifts bits to the left. <br>
`Right Shift (>>):` Shifts bits to the right. <br>

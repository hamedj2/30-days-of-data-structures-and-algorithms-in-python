# 30-days-of-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python
Hi everyone! I'm working on '30 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python'. As a PhD student, I'm refreshing my Python skills and revisiting essential concepts. This project is all about simple, understandable learning. Each day brings a new topic, and I'll share what I learn. Perfect for those starting out or needing a quick refresher.
